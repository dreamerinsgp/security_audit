Q1: How signers are generated ?

## Answer: Signer Generation Process

Signers in Solana CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) are **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)** that are generated from seeds and a program ID. Here's how the process works:

### Location: `agave/program-runtime/src/cpi.rs:913-921`

The signer generation happens in the `translate_signers` function, which is called during CPI setup:

```rust
let signers = S::translate_signers(
    &caller_program_id,
    signers_seeds_addr,
    signers_seeds_len,
    memory_mapping,
    invoke_context,
    check_aligned,
)?;
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `caller_program_id`: The program ID that will derive the signers (the calling program)
   - `signers_seeds_addr`: Memory address in VM space where signer seeds are stored
   - `signers_seeds_len`: Number of signers to generate (max 16, defined by `MAX_SIGNERS`)

2. **Memory Translation** (`translate_signers_rust` function):
   - Translates the signer seeds from VM memory space to host memory space
   - Each signer has a list of seed entries (byte slices)
   - Maximum seeds per signer: `MAX_SEEDS` (typically 16)

3. **PDA Derivation** (lines 677-681):
   ```rust
   let signer = Pubkey::create_program_address(&seeds, program_id)
       .map_err(|err| CpiError::BadSeeds(err))?;
   ```
   - For each signer, collects all seed byte slices
   - Uses `Pubkey::create_program_address()` to derive a PDA from:
     - The seeds (array of byte slices)
     - The program ID
   - This generates a deterministic public key that the program can sign for

4. **Output**:
   - Returns a `Vec<Pubkey>` containing all derived signer addresses
   - These signers are then used to authorize the CPI call

### Key Points

- **Deterministic**: Same seeds + same program ID = same PDA
- **No Private Key**: PDAs don't have private keys; they're derived addresses
- **Program Control**: Only the program that derives the PDA can "sign" for it (by providing the correct seeds)
- **Validation**: The runtime validates that the seeds correctly derive the claimed signer address

### Example Flow

```
Program A wants to make a CPI call with a PDA signer:
1. Program A provides seeds: [b"my-seed", b"another-seed"]
2. Runtime calls translate_signers with Program A's ID
3. create_program_address([b"my-seed", b"another-seed"], program_a_id)
4. Returns derived Pubkey (the PDA signer)
5. This PDA can now be used as a signer in the CPI call
```
